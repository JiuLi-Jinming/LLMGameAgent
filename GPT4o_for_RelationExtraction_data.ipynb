The relations should only add the object itself in triples vector as obj; for the decorative descriptions of the object, please use the rule of Tips 3. Like \"You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here.\" gives \"<west of a white house, have, mailbox>\".\n",
       "(3) When representing an object with additional decorative descriptions, such as 'on', 'in', 'with', 'verb+ing', etc., use their preposition or a simple representation (Like \"a buzzing water fountain has been moved\" gives \"<water fountain, is, buzzing>, <water fountain, is, moved>\") as the relationships (Use with Rule 5). But if an object has another, use 'have'. Like \"One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path\" gives \"<large tree, with, low branches>, <large tree, at, the edge of the path>\" \n",
       "(4) If the input asks for something to 'continue xxx' or 'do xxx', use '<location/door/objects/etc., need/require/etc., something to xxx>'. Like \"Forest This is a forest, with trees in all directions. You would need a machete to go further west.\" gives \"<Forest, need, machete to west>\".\n",

       "(6) If nothing happened, output none.\n",
       "(7) If the Inventory is not empty, please create relationships with the objects and character ('You'). If Inventory is empty or shows 'You don't have anything', output none.\n",
       "(8) For any object in the current location leading by a direction (like 'to the north', 'up to', 'down' and so on) to a new location or any direction can go from observation, use the <Current Location, direction, new location/none> to represent.

You'd think that the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's gratitude for you.\n",

      "   - The text states \"To the southwest is the entrance to the Computer Site.\" According to Rule 9, we represent this as \"<Hall Outside Computer Site, southwest, Computer Site>.\"\n",
      "   - It also mentions \"to the east are stairs up to the fourth floor.\" We represent this as \"<Hall Outside Computer Site, east, stairs up to fourth floor>.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Objects in the Location:**\n",
      "   - The observation mentions \"a maze of twisty little passages, all alike,\" but this is a description of the location itself, not an object within it.\n",
      "   - There are no specific objects mentioned in the location that need to be represented with 'have'.\n",

      "3. **Inventory Analysis:**\n",
      "   - The inventory states: \"You are carrying: a flashlight (providing light).\"\n",
